# Refunds

A Refund can be done by creating a credit memo for an order that has a
captured payment.

## Offline Refunds

Offline refunds are disabled by default for orders paid with Worldline,
since they would cause confusion and support questions for the merchant.

They can however still be enabled in the admin setting
