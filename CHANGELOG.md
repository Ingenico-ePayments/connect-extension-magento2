### Fixed

- Fixes issue in `composer.json` that would prevent the module from being installed.

## 2.1.0 - 2020-01-13

### Changed

- In previous versions, the "pending payment" status was ambiguous: it could either mean that the customer is still in the payment process or that an action of the merchant is required (like a capture for example). From this version onward:
    - If an action is required by the customer the default order status will be "pending".
    - If an action is required by the merchant the default order status will be "pending payment".
- Added a default configuration settings for "amount of days to cancel stale orders" (set to 3).
- Stale orders will now be cancelled if their status is "pending" instead of "pending payment".

### Fixed

- In case of a `REDIRECT` the order will now be set to "pending" instead of "processing". This goes for all redirect cases: challenges, hosted checkouts, payment methods that are redirect-based, etc.
- After a successful challenge the order will be set to "processing" for direct capture and "pending payment" for a delayed settlement.
- Previously, order amount paid and order amount due did not reflect the paid-status of the invoice / payment. This is now fixed.
- Previously, the invoice status did not reflect the payment status. This is now fixed.
    - A status of `PAID`, `CAPTURED` and `CAPTURE_REQUESTED` now mark an invoice as paid.
- Payment transactions get closed properly.
- Fixes a date formatting issue that would make the "cancel stale orders" feature too greedy.
